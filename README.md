### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My favourite languages are NodeJS and C. I am currently a university student but there are repositories such as a fun C project I did [C-object](https://github.com/Y0ursTruly/c-object.git) I did before entering university or <a href="https://github.com/Y0ursTruly/slate.git">Slate</a> which is undergoing rennovations (and will be reborn as something epic) and [Webject](https://github.com/Y0ursTruly/webject.git) which is being properly maintained

### Stuff Done while in University
- [Security Advisory Contribution](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-25hc-qcg6-38wj)
- [Cyber Scavenger Hunt](https://halfhat-start.onrender.com/) where the first level (the given starting link) is to fix a "broken" image and follow its instructions
- [Multiplayer Maze Game](https://a-mazed.onrender.com)
- [Proof of Work CAPTCHA](https://github.com/Y0ursTruly/pow_captcha)
- [Maze Generation Library](https://github.com/Y0ursTruly/maze)
- [Homemade Cipher](https://github.com/Y0ursTruly/homemade-cipher) ~~well technically this one was before university but I separated it from the Slate project that I will renovate~~
- [Custom Data Structure ValueTree](https://github.com/Y0ursTruly/battledudes-elo-bot/blob/master/valueTree.js) which is applied in a discord bot for tracking ELO in a game called [battledudes](https://battledudes.io) ~~not in the game's main discord server but a community made one~~

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on "slate" which is a messaging system that enables users to send messages to each other without routing those messages through the mainserver
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on "hideJS" which is a backend method of hosting in such a way that it completely hides script from the client(yet that script is returned and running on the client)
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with sending files through the messaging system
